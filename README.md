# Frontend Mentor - Single price grid component

![Design preview for the Single price grid component coding challenge](./design/desktop-preview.jpg)

## Welcome! ðŸ‘‹

**To be able to complete this challenge, i used my basic understanding of HTML and CSS, and concepts such as Flexbox and Grid.**

## The challenge

Users are able to:

- View the optimal layout for the component depending on their device's screen size
- See a hover state on desktop for the Sign Up call-to-action

## Building the project

1. Initialized the project as a public repository on [GitHub] and created a repo.
2. Configured the repository and published my code to a web address (https://mgbojikwe.github.io/Single-Price-Grid-Component/). 
3. Structured my content with HTML, then added styles using CSS. 

**Had fun building!** ðŸš€
